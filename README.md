# ROS Mobile Robot Controller

A ROS package for controlling a differential-drive robot (tested on TurtleBot3)  
with trajectory tracking, waypoint navigation, and future autonomous features.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains a **Python-based ROS node** for controlling a mobile robot.

It currently supports:

- Moving straight with heading correction  
- Following polygonal trajectories (triangle, square, etc.)  
- Drawing circular trajectories  
- Navigating to user-defined goal coordinates

> The project is designed as a foundation for learning **robotics algorithms** such as obstacle avoidance, mapping, SLAM, path planning, and localization.
> Files in the *scripts* are not up to date . Planning to update them.

## ðŸ§  Background & Goals

This project aims to serve as a **learning playground for robotics**, combining:

- ROS1 fundamentals (nodes, topics, launch files)  
- Motion control & PID tuning  
- Autonomous navigation stack (obstacle avoidance, SLAM, localization)  
- Path planning algorithms (A\*, D\*, Bug, potential fields)  
- Integration with sensors (Lidar, IMU, Odometry)

By expanding this repository, this can evolve into a complete mobile robot platform.
